# 🏯 Ukiyo-Tone — Philosophy & Brand Identity

## What Ukiyo-Tone Is

**Ukiyo-Tone is a personal visual instrument for thinking in code.**

It is not a theme optimized for novelty, screenshots, or mass customization.  
It is a deliberately constrained environment designed to *disappear* once deep focus begins.

The goal is not excitement.  
The goal is **clarity with character**.

## Core Philosophy

### Restraint Over Abundance
Ukiyo-Tone rejects excess.

- No unnecessary colors  
- No ornamental contrast  
- No features added without structural purpose  

Every visual choice must justify itself through readability, hierarchy, or focus.

---

### Structure Before Decoration
Color is treated as **syntax**, not paint.

- Keywords define grammar  
- Functions express motion  
- Variables carry weight  
- Comments annotate rather than compete  

Nothing exists purely for aesthetics.

---

### Organic, Not Mechanical
Inspired by Ukiyo-e woodblock prints and Sumi-e ink traditions:

- Slight softness is intentional  
- Perfect neutrality is avoided  
- Visual breathing room is respected  

The interface should feel *worked by hand*, not machined.

---

### Long-Session Ergonomics
Ukiyo-Tone is designed for endurance.

- Hours, not minutes  
- Reading, not scanning  
- Debugging, not demos  

If a choice improves screenshots but harms long-term focus, it is rejected.

---

## Brand Identity

### A Personal Instrument
Ukiyo-Tone is:

- Opinionated  
- Internally consistent  
- Willing to say “no”  

It does not attempt to satisfy all users, languages, or preferences equally.  
It serves the author first.

---

### Calm, Sharp, Neutral
The emotional tone is intentional:

- **Calm** → reduces fatigue  
- **Sharp** → preserves precision  
- **Neutral** → avoids emotional noise  

No cheerfulness.  
No aggression.  
No gimmicks.

---

### Cultural Grounding, Not Pastiche
Japanese visual culture is referenced as a **system of constraints**, not decoration.

- Ink density  
- Paper contrast  
- Mineral pigment limits  
- Frame-based composition  

This is translation, not imitation.

---

## Non-Goals

Ukiyo-Tone explicitly does **not** aim to be:

- Highly customizable  
- Trend-following  
- Maximally colorful  
- Universally “best”  

Requests that dilute restraint, consistency, or tone are out of scope.

---

## Decision Framework (For Humans & AI Agents)

When evaluating any change, ask:

1. Does this improve long-session clarity?
2. Does this preserve visual hierarchy?
3. Does this reduce cognitive noise?
4. Would removing this make the theme weaker?

If the answer is unclear — **do nothing**.

## One-Sentence Identity

> *Ukiyo-Tone is a restrained, culturally grounded coding theme designed as a personal instrument — calm, sharp, and built for long hours of focused work.*

This sentence is the project’s north star.
