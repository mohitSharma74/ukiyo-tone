# Ukiyo-Tone (浮世トーン)

**Ukiyo-Tone** is a premium VS Code theme bundle inspired by 17th-century Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock prints and the visual aesthetic of the Edo period. The goal is to translate the high-contrast, organic line work and mineral-pigment palettes of ancient Japanese art into a modern, highly functional developer environment.

## The Theme Bundle

This extension includes four distinct themes:

### 1. Asahi (旭 - Morning Sun)
**Light Theme.** Inspired by fresh Washi paper and early morning light.
*   *Core concept:* High readability, organic paper feel.

### 2. Karesansui (枯山水 - Dry Landscape)
**Zen Garden Theme.** Inspired by moss, stone, and raked sand.
*   *Core concept:* Muted moss tones with bamboo yellow accents for a peaceful focus.

### 3. Tasogare (黄昏 - Twilight)
**Soft Dark Theme.** Inspired by evening landscapes and faded indigo dyes.
*   *Core concept:* Low eye strain, muted atmospheric tones.

### 4. Kuro-Sumi (黒墨 - Black Ink)
**Deep Dark Theme.** Inspired by charcoal ink drawings and midnight shadows.
*   *Core concept:* Dramatic contrast, vivid highlights.

### 5. Kachi-iro (勝ち色 - Victory Color)
**High Contrast Dark Theme.** Inspired by the "lucky" deepest navy indigo worn by Samurai.
*   *Core concept:* Accessibility and sharp focus.

## Design Philosophy

*   **Organic Feel:** Borders and UI elements mimic woodblock frame lines.
*   **Hanko Selection:** Selection color is inspired by the red ink of an artist's signature stamp.
*   **Sumi-e Syntax:** Comments are italicized to mimic hand-written calligraphy, while Classes and Constants are bolded to provide structural "outlines".
