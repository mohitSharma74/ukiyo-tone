**Ukiyo-Tone** is a visual instrument for thinking in code, inspired by 17th-century Japanese Ukiyo-e woodblock prints and Sumi-e ink traditions. It is not designed for novelty or mass appeal, but as a deliberately constrained environment that *disappears* once deep focus begins.

The goal is not excitement; the goal is **clarity with character**.

## The Theme Bundle

This extension includes six distinct themes, each inspired by specific elements of the Edo period aesthetic:

### 1. Asahi (旭 - Morning Sun)

![Asahi](media/Asahi.png)

### 3. Tasogare (黄昏 - Twilight)

**High Contrast Dark Theme.** Inspired by the "lucky" deepest navy indigo worn by Samurai.

## Core Philosophy

Ukiyo-Tone is built on four central pillars defined in our [Philosophy & Brand Identity](PHILOSOPHY.md):

*   **Restraint Over Abundance:** We reject excess. Every visual choice must justify itself through readability, hierarchy, or focus. No unnecessary colors or ornamental contrast.
*   **Structure Before Decoration:** Color is treated as **syntax**, not paint. Keywords define grammar, functions express motion, and variables carry weight.
*   **Organic, Not Mechanical:** Inspired by woodblock prints, slight softness is intentional. Visual breathing room is respected, ensuring the interface feels *worked by hand*.
*   **Long-Session Ergonomics:** Designed for endurance. If a choice improves a screenshot but harms long-term focus, it is rejected.

## Visual Translation

We use Japanese visual culture as a system of constraints to guide the developer experience:

*   **Sumi-e Syntax:** Comments are italicized to mimic hand-written calligraphy, while Classes and Constants are bolded to provide structural "outlines" similar to woodblock frame lines.
*   **Hanko Selection:** The selection color is inspired by the red ink of a *hanko* (artist's signature stamp), providing a clear but culturally grounded focal point.
*   **Calm, Sharp, Neutral:** The emotional tone is intentional—reducing fatigue and preserving precision without emotional noise or gimmicks.

## Usage

### Installation
1. Open the **Extensions** sidebar in VS Code.
2. Search for `Ukiyo-Tone`.
3. Click **Install**.

### Recommended Settings
To fully embrace the *Ukiyo-Tone* philosophy of restraint and focus, we recommend the following editor settings to reduce visual noise:

```json
{
  "editor.renderLineHighlight": "gutter",
  "editor.occurrencesHighlight": false,
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
  "breadcrumbs.enabled": false,
  "editor.guides.indentation": false,
  "editor.guides.bracketPairs": "active"
}
```

## Fonts
This theme pairs exceptionally well with typefaces that balance geometric precision with organic curves.

*   **Primary Recommendation:** [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) (Custom build or standard) — *Its slender, precise feel matches the "sharp" and "ink" aesthetic.*
*   **Alternative:** [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) — *Excellent for the "high readability" goal of the Asahi theme.*
