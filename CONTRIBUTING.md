## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Ukiyo-Tone Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to mohitSharma74.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/mohitSharma74/ukiyo-tone/issues) that might help you. In case you've found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/mohitSharma74/ukiyo-tone/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read [documentation](README.md) to find out if the functionality is meant to be compatible with your system.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/mohitSharma74/ukiyo-tone/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/mohitSharma74/ukiyo-tone/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure the issue arises in your specific configuration, providing as much specific information as possible will help us to find the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Ukiyo-Tone, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/mohitSharma74/ukiyo-tone/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mohitSharma74/ukiyo-tone/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Ukiyo-Tone users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
